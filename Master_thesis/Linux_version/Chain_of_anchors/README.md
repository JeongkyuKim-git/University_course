## An Anchoring-Based DNA Sequence Alignment Algorithm

Python Interpretation to align pairs of sequence reads based on a novel heuristic anchoring method that identifies the best sequence alignment.

Run using the following command:
```
python3 main.py <Reference.fast directory> <Query.fasta directory> <k-mer size> <outputfilename>
```

The final output file generated is found in the root project directory under ```<outputfilename>.jres```
